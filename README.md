## setup

2. install Hugo and Prepros.
3. Open prepros and add cloned folder as a project.
4. minimise prepros and don't look at it again. CAUTION: It will open a localhost server/window, do not use that/close that webpage.

Anish, I will stab you if you directly edit the css, look at the scss files in static folder. As you make edits to SCSS files, prepros will compile it and turn it into css. If there's an error, it won't compile, prepros usually tells you where the error is.
