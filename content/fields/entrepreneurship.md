## What is Entrepreneurship?
Entrepreneurship is the act of creating a business or businesses while building and scaling it to generate a profit.

However, as a basic entrepreneurship definition, it’s a bit limiting. Entrepreneurship today is also about transforming the world by solving big problems. Like initiating social change, creating an innovative product or presenting a new life-changing solution.

What the entrepreneurship definition doesn’t tell you is that entrepreneurship is what people do to take their career and dreams into their hands and lead it in the direction of their own choice. It’s about building a life on your own terms. No bosses. No restricting schedules. And no one holding you back. Entrepreneurs are able to take the first step into making the world a better place, for everyone in it.
