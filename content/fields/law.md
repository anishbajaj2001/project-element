The law affects every aspect of our lives; it governs our conduct from the cradle to the grave and its influence even extends from before our birth to after our death. We live in a society which has developed a complex body of rules to control the activities of its members. There are laws which govern working conditions (e.g. by laying down minimum standards of health and safety), laws which regulate leisure pursuits (e.g. by banning alcohol on trains), and laws which control personal
relationships (e.g. by prohibiting dual matrimony).

The world of law is expanding manifolds with new technologies, innovations and inventions coming up which need to be legislated, coupled with this accelerated growth are problems like modern day slavery, immigrants and other basic human rights violations which are on the rise.

Study of the Law for this very reason is multifarious, there is something for everyone, no matter where your interests lie. The only prerequisite for practicing law is to have strong commitment towards bringing about justice and equality in whichever field you choose.

During Project Element, we would begin by talking about Law and its various branches how they are different yet united. We will briefly touch upon the Common Law and which countries use the system. Reasoning is a major part of the study of law, not only for entrance examinations but throughout a personâ€™s career as a Lawyer so we would try to understand what reasoning, specifically legal reasoning is all about.

The fields of law which would be discussed during the sessions would be Civil Rights Law (including Torts), Business (Corporate) Law, Criminal Law, Intellectual Property Rights, Human Rights Law, International Law, Environmental Law, Labour Law, Entertainment Law and Sports Law.

A major topic of the session would be the stereotypical qualities that are attributed to lawyers and how possessing them or not possessing them would make a difference in your pursuit of law as a vocation. The aim would be to try to break the mentality that to be a lawyer you must be loud and argumentative or that lawyers are dishonest, arrogant and detached.

At the culmination of this session the attendee would have basic knowledge of what the field of law is about, the various branches she or he can choose to work in, an elementary roadmap to joining the Legal sector, what life as a Legal professional is like and hopefully find that source of inspiration which will keep them going and help them in achieving whatever goals they set.
