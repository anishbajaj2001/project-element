The sessions for photography intend to give an idea of what photography is about, and why it remains to this day, one of the foremost fields of visual media. The sessions will walk attendees through the various categories of photography and how artists use photography to document the world. Heavy emphasis will be given to studying the work of renowned artists in the field, and to evolving as photographers, being able to convey ideas and thoughts through photography.

By the end of the session, the attendees shall have a greater appreciation for the art, will be able to make better images themselves and would have had first-hand experience of carrying out photography in a simulated professional environment, thereby providing essential insight regarding if it is their true calling.
As the school already organizes weekly photography classes through SUPW and Work Experience, Project Element does not focus on building a technical foundation, but rather appreciating the skill as an art. Through interactive exercises and regular group interactions, all the attendees will return with a greater love for the arts in general, regardless of where their true passion lies.

Having said that, a good base in photography as a skill will serve well to make the sessions more meaningful, and hence likely attendees are recommended to visit and go through the following links, of course, with consent from their guardian(s):
