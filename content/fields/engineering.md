IIT, NIT, VIT, BITS, the list goes on. Take a step back, breath, ask yourself â€“ is it your true calling? The sessions on engineering are here to help with just that. Over the course of three days, the sessions on engineering will explore the subject in entirely new ways. Drawing inspiration from the greatest inventions in history, together we will discover what it is like to make something meaningful, to put ideas in action, solve problems and feel like an engineer. 
With equal emphasis on hands-on experience, as well logical problem-solving, the attendees will walk away with a great appreciation for the field regardless if it is there true passion or not. The sessions aim to provide a new outlook to how we perceive the world around us, and if successful, inspire countless mesmerising works in the future.
Project Element: Engineering does not require attendees to possess exceptional knowledge of the field beforehand. Get up, look around you, and come with an open mind.
Oh also, be prepared to be challenged :).
