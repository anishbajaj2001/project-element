“Why do you make art? What does art mean to you? What is art?” are just some of the few questions that you’ll encounter time and again as art aspirants and enthusiasts,and they’re right next to a bunch of other philosophical, metaphysical questions like the meaning and purpose of life, along with various concerns voiced by parents and relatives that need to be reassured time and again (“ No, Mom, it’s not just painting” or “Nope, this is not making Manish Malhotra-inspired lehengas”, for instance).

But we’re here to tell you that perhaps the only insight you’ll have gained over the course of these three days is that the why is unimportant. Depending on your mood, on any given day, you could attribute making art to a high-minded impulse to connect with others or to understand the world or a narcissistic coping mechanism or a desire to be famous or therapy or as your religious discipline or to provide a sense of control or a desire to surrender control, or as catharsis, yada yada yada.

Whatever the reason, an inner compulsion, an innate urge exists, which you continue to indulge in, and if you didn’t, you would feel horrible. So whether attempting to make art is noble or selfish, the fact remains that you will do it nevertheless. Anything past this statement is mere speculation.

“Design can be art. Design can be aesthetics. Design is so simple, that’s why it is so complicated.”- Paul Rand, graphic designer

While there do exist points of convergence between art and design, the myth that they are one in the same must be busted. There are actually huge gaps between the two disciplines and they can all be very easily identified through a critical comparison of both practices, something which we intend to take up in great detail in the coming days.

Art is about personal expression. As such, it has intrinsic and independent value. The purpose and value of art is fully contained within the art itself. Design, on the other hand, is about use. Its value is dependent on external factors, namely the purpose that it serves and the user that it serves that purpose for. In this sense, design is contextual and its value depends on the context of its use.

And this is what we aim to help you realise by the end of this initiative- whether art or design, or even both, drive and impassion you.
