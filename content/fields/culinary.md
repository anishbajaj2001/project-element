> “I don’t like looking back. I’m always constantly looking forward. I’m not the one to sort of sit and cry over spilt milk. I’m too busy looking for the next cow.”
<br> <br> - Gordon Ramsay

A human nose can smell a trillion smells, the tongue can taste a myriad of flavors; every time I think of the possibilities, it makes me believe.

Food connects people. It connects nations, it connects communities, it connects people to their memories. Food is a personal experience. Its different for everyone and special to each in its own way. It has evolved over centuries and brought people closer in its own way. 
<br><br>
Food is not just a mere transformation of ingredients to final dishes but it is what represents the feeling, the thought of the creator. It not only intensifies our own feelings but instills new ones in us. It is a means of expressing oneself and it is a form of communicating with the one who eats. Food is simple yet complex.

The sessions for Culinary Arts intends to provide a beginner’s peek into the Industry, where the attendees will be shown the ropes of the kitchen. The sessions focus on building a technical foundation to work on in the future, as well as increasing the appreciation of the person towards the art and hard work required.
With the help of a blend of interactive sessions, talks, visual aids, live and video masterclasses and hands on training, the attendees will get to experience and learn in a stimulative environment, which will gauge their interests and aptitude for the Kitchen Life.  And the aim is that by the end of the sessions, the participants not only have a grasp of the basic skills and an understanding of their importance, but also the confidence to execute them first hand.
