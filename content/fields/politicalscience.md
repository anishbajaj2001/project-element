Whether it involves complex ideas such as justice and equality, or who gets to take the television remote- you will find power relations everywhere. Power is everywhere, and because politics is about power, politics is everywhere. Quite simply put, political science is the study of power.

Political science is often understood as the study of governments, and how a state is run. While this is a part of the subject, political science includes fields such as public policy, international relations, war studies, political economy and comparative politics. Although you might not be associated with politics in any way, your life is influenced by it in almost every aspect.

Studying theories by different political theorists about basic concepts like democracy, freedom, equality, justice, secularism, etc makes you realise how complex these seemingly simple concepts are. Essentially, political science opens your mind and makes you aware of what is going around in the world.

Through Project Element, you will learn more about the subject, the skills it teaches you, as well as the career options you can pursue after obtaining a degree in political science. We look forward to seeing you there!
