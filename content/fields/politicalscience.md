> "Not all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man’s character, give him power” 
<br> - Abraham Lincoln

Whether it involves complex ideas such as justice and equality, or who gets to take the television remote- you will find power relations everywhere. Power is everywhere, and because politics is about power, politics is everywhere. Quite simply put, political science is the study of power. 

Political science is often understood as the study of governments, and how a state is run. While this is a part of the subject, political science includes fields such as public policy, international relations, war studies, political economy and comparative politics. Essentially, political science opens your mind and makes you aware of what is going around in the world. 

Although you might not be associated with politics in any way, your life is influenced by it in almost every aspect. Political events from 100, 200 years ago are still relevant because it is important to understand them to understand the present society. Studying theories by different political theorists about basic concepts like democracy, freedom, equality, justice, secularism, etc makes you realise how complex these seemingly simple concepts are. The study of political science, and more specifically political theory helps you answer questions like how should society be organized? Why do we need government? What is the best form of government? Does law limit our freedom? What does the state owe its citizens? What do we owe each other as citizens?
