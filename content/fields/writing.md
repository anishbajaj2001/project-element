<i>The Little Red Riding Hood.
<br>
"It was dark inside the forest."
<br>
Let's start the story in a different way.
<br> 
"It was dark inside the wolf."
<br> </i> <br>
Human beings have to create, because that's what we do. It all starts with a thought. A song, a choreography, a poem, a sketch. They all start with a single thought.

And when we can pen that thought down into a simple, comprehensible sentence, one that captures the intricacy, depth and beauty of that thought, we call that creative writing.

You can watch millions of tutorials and get loads of advice, but it boils down to just this: hold my attention. You can play with margins and fonts all you want. You can write a thrilling murder mystery or a 400-paged novel about toothpaste; if you have my attention throughout, it's a good book. If you lose my attention, start over. Write. Write again. Write better. Fail. Fail again. Fail better. Write. God made the Recycle Bin for writers.

No one can teach you how to think (the government tries, of course). But someone can show you how to pen your thought down. And when you start seeing your own, original thought on paper, it's absolute magic.

So, think.
<br>
Think.
<br>
Think.
<br>
Ready?
<br>
Now, write.
