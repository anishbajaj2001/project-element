This intro course involves understanding how present-day living organisms came to be and how they function. Biology can focus upon topics such as the entire planet and various populations or something as specific as single cells. It is the study of how living organisms can be used for the economic benefit of humans but simulteously shows how to protect and preserve this wealth. Biology as a field draws from other branches of science and applies those laws to living beings.

As a vast field, Biology provides immense career opportunities. However, we understand that choosing a particular branch can be rather daunting and confusing for students. Hence, we intend to make the students aware of the lines they can pursue and help the students find their passion for the subject through quizzes and interactive projects, including hands-on experience at the laboratory. 

We look forward to interacting with the students and being instrumental in helping them embark on their future endeavours.
