Biology involves dissecting Life itself in a metaphorical as well as literal sense. It is about decipheringthe poetry that abounds in organisms everywhere and simultaneously challenging the scientific limits of knowledge.

Biology, simply put, is the study of life. It involves studying and understanding how present-day living organisms came to be and how they function. It can focus on broad topics such as the entire planet and various populations or it can as specific as studying single cells. It is the study of how living organisms can be used for the economic benefit of humans but at the same time, also involves the study of how to protect and preserve this wealth. Biology is a field that draws from other branches of science and applies those laws to living beings.

Biology is a vast field, providing immense career opportunities. However, we understand that choosing a particular branch can be rather daunting and confusing for students. Hence, we intend to make the students aware of the lines they can pursue and help the students find their passion for the subject through quizzes and interactive projects, including hands-on experience at the laboratory. We look forward to interacting with the students and being instrumental in helping them embark on their future endeavours.
