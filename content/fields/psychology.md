Psychology is the study of peopleâ€™s experiences; their behaviours; and the functioning of their mind. A scientific discipline- it allows us to assign causes to the behaviours of different people, understand the working of their brain and their mind, develop hypotheses and carry out experiments to test them and so much more. 

The stigma attached to mental disorders- including disorders as common as a Phobias or Depression and those as debilitating as Schizophrenia and Bipolar and related disorders- prevents people who struggle with them from seeking the help they require to lead a better adapted life. Learning psychology helps an individual understand these disorders better and also bring about a change their perception of the afflicted individuals. 

A common misconception is that after studying Psychology, students can either become counsellors, Psychologists or Psychiatrists. In reality- Psychology, being a wide-ranging discipline, is applicable to virtually any field- be it Marketing, Sports, Education, Art, Human Resource Management, Dance, Neuroscience, Advertising and so on. In this workshop, we will be throwing more light on the following fields of psychology and the career options available to those who specialize in them: 

>&nbsp;1. Industrial/ Organisational Psychology<br>2. Criminal Psychology <br> 3. Clinical Psychology <br> 4. Counselling Psychology <br> 5. Dance Movement Therapy <br> 6. Child/Developmental Psychology <br> 7. Education Psychology

Using art, role play and other activities, discussions and videos-this workshop will aim at challenging these stigmas and misconceptions; introducing the participants to the discipline and its various applications, informing them about the varying degree options available to them if they choose to study this discipline after high school and increasing their awareness about the various career options open to them after studying this discipline.
