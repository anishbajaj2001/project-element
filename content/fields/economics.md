Sometime before 1989, a Soviet official was visiting Number 10 Downing Street, when he turns to the Economist Paul Seabright and asks him, 
“Tell me… who is in charge of the supply of bread to the population of London?”
Seabright replies, 
“No one is in charge.” 
The question is comical, but the answer – nobody - is dizzying. The lack of a clear leader in the production, delivery, regulation, and distribution of bread to the 8.2 million people of London seems shockingly strange, yet true. 
When an economist drags his attention away from the loaf of bread on the shelf and looks around the shop, the organisational challenges of our lives seem even greater. The complexity of the system that made the shop possible defies easy description: think of the accumulated centuries of design and development, from the paper upon which the books are printed to the software that keeps track of the stock, not to mention the everyday miracles of organisation through which the bread is bound, stored, delivered, stacked and stored. 
All of this can seem callous to those who aren’t aware of the economic reasoning behind it, so we’ll explain it to you. 
Economics affects everything under the sun: how we dress to our social relationships. A policy that can cause double digit growth in China can drag almost every other major economy into a fateful recession. It's sheer irregularity is what makes economics both frustrating and enjoyable.
The greatest minds of our time - ranging from Adam Smith to Karl Marx to JM Keynes - have tried to unravel the great mysteries of this subject. Some answered questions on which was the best way to produce pins, others sought to create a measure of human progress that could be captured by a single number. It is a tool used to fashion empires from ruins, while also explaining why your parents ask you to wait just one more week until the price of the latest smartphone falls to an acceptable level. In a turbulent world, where the winds change every second, and a torrential stream of information bombards us, economics is a tool to de-mystify the chaos. 
 
We crave certainty where none exists.
