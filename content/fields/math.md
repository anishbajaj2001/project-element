Who would’ve thought you could mix math and limericks, and come up with the concept of equation limericks? The world’s full of unexpected quirks like this, and the world of math even more so. Even some of the most well known math concepts can be extremely surreal when examined closely. Pythagoras told us that there exist certain triplets (A,B,C),  such that A<sup>2</sup> + B<sup>2</sup> = C<sup>2</sup>. But try to find a triplet (A,B,C) such that A<sup>3</sup> +B<sup>3</sup> = C<sup>3</sup>, and you get nowhere. Another mathematician, Russell, posed a question which befuddled all his fellow intellectuals: in a town of all men, a barber shaves every man who does not shave himself; does the barber shave himself? Infinity is another mathematical concept that is intrinsically counter-intuitive. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. And yet, there are <u>exactly as many numbers</u> between 0 and 1 as there are between 0 and a million. 

In our three day session, we’re going to explore math from a different perspective: through puzzles and paradoxes like these. These mathematical anomalies are going to touch upon concepts of Discrete Math: Numbers, Probability, Sets, Logics.

The beauty of math lies in the fact that everything around us behaves in mathematically determined ways, making it applicable in virtually every field of study. Connecting the dots between theoretical concepts and their practical applications is like a game. So we’re going to play this game by solving puzzles and paradoxes. It’s going to be like a treasure hunt. X marks the spot, all we’ve got to do is find x.
