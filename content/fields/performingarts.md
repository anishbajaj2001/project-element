# Theatre

> “Good acting is taking yourself away from the character.”
<br> - Leonardo DiCaprio

> "Good acting is being in character"
<br> Stanislavski

> “It’s a character, not a human being. Play with it.”
<br> Anthony Hopkins

> “Think of the character as another human being.”
<br> Jim Carrey

> “Acting is easy. It comes naturally.”
<br> Shahrukh Khan

> “Acting is never easy.”
<br> Nawazuddin Siddiqui

> “Acting is the ultimate truth. It doesn’t get any truer than this.”
<br> Robert De Niro

> “What is good acting but a convincing lie?”
<br> Laurence Olivier

Now it’s near impossible to tell you whether acting is the truth or a lie, whether it’s easy or difficult, whether you should be or pretend. It doesn’t matter if you’re a Shahrukh Khan fan or a Fardeen Khan fan (seriously?). It doesn’t matter if you do method acting or if you’re a natural.

They all started with the basics.

And so should you.

Voice throw, voice modulation, expression, body language. A grasp over all of this is essential if you want to be a stage actor or a reel actor, and most of this comes in use even if you don’t go near the acting industry at all.
<br>
So welcome.

Field.

# Dance
The culture of dance as a component of performance and expression has evolved over
centuries. The position that the art of dancing holds in contemporary understanding is miles
apart from the dances of medieval courts.

With changing perspectives towards the art form, the thought of pursuing such an artistic
direction is now often overlooked and sometimes even thought negatively towards. Through this
workshop, we aim to expand your knowledge about dance as a vocation and take it beyond
simply a hobby.

During the three days of the workshop, our focus will be on addressing concerns and queries of
the students, understanding a variety of styles, improvement and expansion of technique,
introduction to choreography, along with discussing possibilities in dance as a vocation.
