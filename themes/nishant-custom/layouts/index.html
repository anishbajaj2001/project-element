                        <p><i>“What do you want to be when you grow up?”</i></p>
												<p>All of us have answered this question many times as children. The answer you gave then probably did not sound like what you would say if you were asked the same question today. As children we all have simple ideas of what we want to do in life. Somewhere along the way, these dreams are sculpted, moulded and transformed into something entirely new.</p>
												<p>You are all designed for a something you are uniquely suited to. You show both a natural inclination towards it and a interest for it, and while doing it you maximize your capacity for excellence. It is this something which is said to be your ‘element’.</p>
												<p>Project Element is an attempt to help you find your calling, and thereby yourself. Through Project Element, we hope to show you why we love doing what we love doing and, in the process, help you discover the same. Through it we will try providing the tools for you to discover the best you can be. </p>

                        <h1 class="home-section-heading">How it Works</h1>
												<p>Based on the skillset and capacity of the class of 2019 of the MIS, 15 different fields of interest have been chosen. For each field, you can find brief introductions and some recommendations for you to understand better what we aim to offer to the students.</p>
												<p>Starting in the third week of June, we will be conducting physical workshops for each of these fields for students of classes 8th and 9th. These will be held in The Mother’s International School.</p>
												<p>A workshop for each field lasts for 3 days and a child can opt to do upto workshops for 3 fields. Each day will be an extensive and hands-on interaction with people specialising in the field, allowing the child to gain increased exposure and a better understanding of the area of interest.</p>
